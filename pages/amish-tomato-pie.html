          you'll realize that it was worth the wait.</p></b>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9-inch pie crust</li>
      <li>2 pounds heirloom tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 pound Roma tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup diced raw bacon</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sliced leek</li>
      <li>2 cups grated white Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Fontina cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh basil, torn into small pieces</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>Chill pie dough for about 1 hour.</p>
      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on the lower oven rack.</p>
      <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>Slice heirloom tomatoes into 1/2-inch rounds. Remove seeds with your fingers.
      Place 6 slices on paper towels or a clean cloth and cover with more paper towels or another clean cloth.
      Arrange the remaining slices on a wire rack.
      Cut Roma tomatoes into 1/2-inch slices, remove seeds, and arrange them on the rack as well.</p>
      <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>Line a deep-dish, 9-inch pie plate with dough.
      Place 2 layers of aluminum foil over the entire surface. Fill with pie weights or dried beans.</p>
      <li>Step 5</li>
      <p>Bake pie crust on the preheated baking sheet on the bottom rack. Place tomatoes on a higher rack.
      Reduce temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
      Bake until the bottom of the pie crust has lost its
      translucent raw look and the edges have just started to color, 12 to 15 minutes.</p>
      <li>Step 7</li>
      <p>Remove pie crust and allow to cool. Continue baking the tomatoes until they are wilted,
      about 40 minutes total. Remove and allow to cool. Keep the oven on.</p>
      <li>Step 8</li>
      <p>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat,
      turning occasionally, until some of the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes.
      Add sliced leek. Cook until bacon is crisp and the leeks have softened and browned, 
      about 5 more minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and allow to cool.</p>
      <li>Step 9</li>
      <p>Place bacon-leek mixture, Cheddar, Fontina, mayonnaise, basil, egg, and mustard in a bowl.
      Season with salt and pepper. Mix to combine.</p>
      <li>Step 10</li>
      <p>Spread 1/3 mixture on the bottom of the pie crust. Arrange 1/2 of the roasted tomatoes on top, overlapping heirlooms with Roma tomatoes. Spread another 1/3 of the mixture over the tomatoes and arrange the remaining roasted tomatoes on top. Add the last 1/3 of the mixture and gently press the fresh tomato slices on top in a decorative pattern. Arrange foil around the edges of the pie crust to protect them from burning, taking care that the foil doesn't touch the tomatoes.</p>
      <li>Step 11</li>
      <p>Bake until browned and bubbly on top, about 40 minutes. Cool completely before serving.</p>
